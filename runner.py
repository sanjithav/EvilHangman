    Class Runner is the driver program for the Hangman program. It reads 
    a dictionary of words to be used during the game and then plays a game with
    the user.

    This is a cheating version of hangman that delays picking a word
    to keep its options open. You can change the setting for DEBUG to see
    how many options are still left on each turn and what patterns are
    being generated from the guess.

    Based on a program by Stuart Reges, modified by Mike Scott and Jesse Zou.
